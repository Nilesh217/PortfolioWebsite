Issues witht he website: 

1_ Looking fine on the website but very poor on terms on responsiveness  
2_ Sidebar is must and is missing 
3_ Carousel is missing in place of images  
4_ Follow up pointer is a luxury but is missing   


What I did? 

1_ Went to favicon.ico and generated a favicon and added it in the favicon folder in the main directory :https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
